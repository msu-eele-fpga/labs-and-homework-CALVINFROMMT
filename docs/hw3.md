## Homework 3: Synchronizer VHDL

## Overview
In this homework we created a Synchronizer in VHDL using a behaviroal modeling technique that implemented a 2 D-Flip-flop.  The synchronizer is able to take in a signal that is asychronise with the rising edge of the clock signal and output a signal that is synchronise with the rising edge of the clock.
