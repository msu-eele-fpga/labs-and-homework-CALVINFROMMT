# Lab 4: LED Pattern.
## Project Overview
We combined our Async Conditioner created in homework with an LED pattern generator and a clock generator.  
Prior to starting the project a block diagram of my system architecture was created.  

## Functional Requirements
### System Architecture
### Implementation Details
#### User LED Pattern
I created a pattern that mimicked Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.  
Each LED was designated a letter on the key scale and I used the elementary piano key scale of A through F. 
A case statement was used that incremented through the keys for the song.
