# Lab 5: Signal Tap
## Project Overview
In this lab we used our project from lab 4 and connected the signal tap analyzer to see how the state logic and output looks when executing the code on the FPGA.

## Deliverables:

## Question: 
How much FPGA on-chip memory was required to monitor your signals?

 - 2 memory blocks which was 6784 bits of Memory.
